# VBA-challenge
This is a repository to hold files for the VBA challenge assignment for Northwestern Data Science Bootcamp.
The code in this assignment was written using the lessons in class.
The ws.Cells(yearly_change_row, 11).NumberFormat = "0.00%" was found using Google's LLM Bard. I used this to properly format the cells as percent with two decimal places.
